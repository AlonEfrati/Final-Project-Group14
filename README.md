For starting the application some requirements are needed.
- graphDB
- html,css and js editor (like visualstudiocode)

Steps:
1. Upload the ontologies in a new repository in GraphDB
2. Copy the link of the repository of GraphDB
3. Change line 87 of the main.js file to the link from GraphDB

Open up the index.html file and use the application!
If you use a free version of GraphDB, it could give the error the you surpassed the free heap memory. Just wait some seconds and try to choose the country, it should work fine now.
