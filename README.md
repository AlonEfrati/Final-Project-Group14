K&amp;D Final project assignment 
For starting the application some requirements are needed.
- GraphDB
- html,css and js editor (like visualstudiocode)

Steps:
1. Upload the ontologies in a new repository in GraphDB
2. Make sure to upload the ontology with this Base IRI: http://www.semanticweb.org/jespe/football#
3. Copy the link of the repository of GraphDB
4. Change line 161 of the main.js file to the link from GraphDB

Choose the country you want the information from and enjoy the data!

ERRORS -- 
Open up the index.html file and use the application!
If you use a free version of GraphDB, it could give the error the you surpassed the free heap memory. Just wait some seconds and try to choose the country, it should work fine now. 
If you can not retrieve the data, try to install the moesif cors extension. This should resolve the problem
